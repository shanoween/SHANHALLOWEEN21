# STARLOG: 31/10/2021

Woke up this morning to check my Terra-Algo, it seems to have dropped significant rankings, so looks like I'm going to have to go back to the drawing board with that one.
Interesting thing happened this morning though, turns out Casper only has a hankering for meal enhancements so he gave me his croissants, looks like I don't need to waste
my credits. Not going to lie but it tasted kinda ```funky``` and I don't feel so good (rip Tony Stark, my idol -- love you 3000).

Welp free food aside, looks like we're heading back to work, project Vision is nearly complete. Soon I shall be able to immortalise myself as a neural network right here, stay tuned!
